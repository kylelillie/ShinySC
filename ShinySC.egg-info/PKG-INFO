# ShinySC
A straight-forward wrapper to build customized table links to Statistics Canada data tables.

If you already know the productId and filters for the table 
you want, simply call:
          
          url = ShinySC.make_url(fitlers={...})

Addtionally, you can specify date ranges or number of recent periods:
          
            url = ShinySC.make_url(periods=5)
            url = ShinySC.make_url(start='2020-01-01',end='2022-01-01')

The returned custom URL that can be used to download a CSV file would be:

If you don't know what table you want, you can programmatically
search for tables that match your criteria using:
          
        ShinySC.search(query,last_updated,dates,status)

        query: terms to search for in table names, descriptions, and surveys
        last_updated: 'YYYY-MM-DD' to search for in last updated field
        dates: list of two strings [start_date,end_date] to filter tables by date range
        status: 'active' or 'archived' tables
          
Call ShinySC.describe(productId) to see available dimensionsthat can be used for filtering.
          
Call ShinySC.update_list(date='YYYY-MM-DD') to see recently updated tables for a specfiic date.
Add in a productId to see if that specific table was updated on that date.
          ShinySC.update_list(id=35100003,date='2023-01-01')
